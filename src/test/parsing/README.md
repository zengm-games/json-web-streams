fail2-fail33 and pass1-pass5 come from http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/ but some failing tests were renamed because they really should pass:

- fail1 -> pass4
- fail18 -> pass5

The n_ and y_ ones come from github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/tree/1ef36fa01286573e846ac449e8683f8833c5b26a/test_parsing - n_ means it is invalid JSON, y_ means it is valid.
